<p>For those unfamiliar with momo, it's a type of dumpling filled with various ingredients, typically cooked by steaming. As the only vegetarian in the household, I'm grateful that my family accommodates my dietary preference by making vegetable-filled momos, although I've been told that those with meat fillings are quite exceptional.</p>

<p>When we make momos, we all gather around the kitchen. I usually handle the chopping, while my siblings take care of preparing the dough, and our parents assist with various tasks. As we work, we chat, share stories, and it becomes a precious moment of bonding for all of us.</p>

<p>All in all, making momos together has become a cherished activity that brings us closer as a family.</p>
