<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fare thee well, my dear traveler<br>Our journey, though short and lively, has come to an end,<br>Our lives have parted our ways, my dear friend<br>With only hope to meet you one day or another</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This load of joy and laughter and a little bit of tear,<br>The ones we picked along our way<br>Oh, forget not the fear we had at night and the laughter by day<br>Fare thee well, my friend,Â  let this way be the answer to your 'where?'</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fare thee well, my dear mate,<br>And if our ways shall ever cross again<br>Though weary and broken we may be by then<br>Lets raise a toast to this jaunt and our twisted fate.</p>
