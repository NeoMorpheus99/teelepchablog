<p>I spent the day cleaning and fixing up my old books, giving them the love they've earned over the years. As I gazed at the stacks of books, memories flooded back, reminding me of my deep-rooted love for reading that goes way back, as far as I can remember.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the good old days, we used to have these wonderful things called "book fairs" at school. I miss them; they don't seem to happen much nowadays. During those fairs, I would pester my parents to buy me more books, maybe a bit too insistentlyâ€”it was almost like I couldn't get enough.</p>

<p>Then came the day I got my very first library membership at the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck Public Library, back in fourth grade. Saturdays became special because of the book reading events. I'd join a bunch of other kids, and we'd listen to people telling stories. It was fascinating.</p>

<p>Since then, I've been on a journey through the incredible worlds created by various writers and their unique storytelling styles.The classics, like Charles Dickens' masterpieces such as "A Tale of Two Cities," "Great Expectations," and "Oliver Twist," linger in my memory, faint yet timeless.&nbsp; Hours would slip away as I got lost in the Percy Jackson series, where Greek gods with modern touch came to life in my imagination.&nbsp; Then later on I got introduced to Sherlock Holmes, one of my favorite fictional characters to date.</p>

<p>I never really had a specific genre in mind; I was open to anything that caught my interest. Whether it was embarking on thrilling adventures with Jack Reacher in his suspenseful novels or delving into the realms of self-help and financial literature, I found fascination in the diversity of stories and ideas. Each book offered a unique experience, and the joy of exploring different genres added a rich tapestry to my love for reading. The unpredictability of where the next book might take me always kept the excitement alive.</p>

<p>Life has gotten busier, and I admit I don't read as much these days. But recently, I started reading a book by Andrew Duff entitled, "Sikkim: Requiem for a Himalayan Kingdom." So far, it's been a real treat exploring the events that shaped modern-day Sikkim. If I manage to carve out some spare time, I'll definitely share my thoughts on it.</p>
