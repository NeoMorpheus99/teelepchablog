<p>The light has set much like the sun at a distant hill<br>Through the woods in this darkened night, I must travel still,<br>How merry was the day, that I met few strangers along<br>Though traveled few miles with me, they journeyed where their paths belong</p>

<p>Many like me, must have traveled in this moonless night,<br>They also, like me, must have longed for a little light,<br>The woods, though many, are lifeless and dead,<br>So, in this darkened night, alone I must journey ahead</p>

<p>The distant stars in heaven keeps a watchful eyes,<br>As in this tiring journey all hopes slowly begin to die<br>But yet again has not the seasons changed, so, wouldn't the dawn bring some new light,<br>So, my dear weary heart, we must travel through this night. </p>
