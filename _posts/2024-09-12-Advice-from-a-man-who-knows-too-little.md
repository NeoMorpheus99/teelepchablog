<p>If you have a story to tell, tell it, my friend,<br>Fear not the deaf ears nor the tongues that offend.<br>For they are many, but few as brave as you,<br>Who stood tall when the gust of doubt blew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often mocked with silence<br>And tossed with rejections and defiance<br>Many will flatter but hold fast my friend.<br>For I have seen dreams buried before its end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have come to learn, quite late in life, <br>It’s the journey, not the destination, for which we strive.<br>For now I see the marks I’ve left behind,<br>Holding memories no where else to find</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, If you have a story to tell, tell it, my friend,<br>For our days are numbered anyway, approaching the end.<br>Some will meet the grave a little too soon,<br>While others linger beneath the same moon.</p>
