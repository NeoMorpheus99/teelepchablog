<p><strong>What does it mean to love your country?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>

<p>I often have this thought, at times  contemplating for hours on end. Suppose if I do love my country, how do we quantify it or express it? It does sound absurd to think of quantifying an abstract concept like patriotism, but in 2020, amidst the chaos of Covid-19, I felt I truly understood what it means to love one's motherland.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, a little back story, 2020 is the year that our generation will never forget. Covid-19, came with a wave of so many disruptions, deaths and in some ways opportunities. The world was in chaos, our small kingdom of roughly 800 thousand was also profoundly affected. Yet, much of the adversity was mitigated by the actions of the government, policy makers, officials, and, above all, the leadership of our King.</p>

<p>The streets lay deserted, consequently<em> </em>businesses suffered, and many struggled to make ends meet. It was during this time that I witnessed an act of selflessness that left a lasting impression on me. Our King initiated aid efforts for affected citizens, even auctioning shares held in the name of Sungchob Fund and Kidu Funds to replenish the reserve for the National Resilience Fund. This ensured continued support for income and interest payments under the Druk Gyalpo’s Relief Kidu.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only that, following His Majesty The King’s concerns about stray dogs starving during the lockdown, a mass feeding of the dogs was also initiated. He tirelessly visited every part of the country, sometimes traversing on foot where roads were impassable, and always humbly adhering to quarantine rules after visiting red zones. One poignant photo, released later, depicted our majestic King looking weary yet filled with concern for his people.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was in these moments that the weight of the words we casually uttered during our school days, "I love my country," truly sank in.  In the words of John F. Kennedy, "Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country." This sentiment encapsulates what it truly means to love one's country – to contribute without seeking personal gain, and never at the expense of harming another nation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To love one's subjects so deeply as to shoulder their burdens, and to carry the weight of 800 thousand lives, is a testament to his exemplary leadership. We fellow Bhutanese, with all due respect, rightfully call Him, ‘The people’s King’.</p>

<p><em>“Throughout my reign I will never rule you as a King. I will protect you as a parent, care for you as a brother and serve you as a son. I shall give you everything and keep nothing; I shall live such a life as a good human being that you may find it worthy to serve as an example for your children; I have no personal goals other than to fulfill your hopes and aspirations. I shall always serve you, day and night, in the spirit of kindness, justice and equality.”</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In honor and remembrance of His Majesty's deeds, on the occasion of his birth anniversary, I offer my eternal respect, loyalty, and gratitude, forever at his disposal.</p>
