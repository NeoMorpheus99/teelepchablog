<p>Think of it as just a hypothetical thought experiment, might be a little philosophical for some people's taste, but no harm giving it a thought, so the situation is </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine a person very close to you. Suddenly one day you come to know that they are  terminally ill and have few months left to live. You talk to the doctor and he tells you that they can only reduce the pain, but cannot delay the inevitable. The medicines that are required has to be specially imported and thus it is not going to be cheap. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, now the question arises.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You know that the person has only few months left to live, so, is it worth spending all your hard earned money into someone who is eventually not going to pay you back?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All your time, effort and care would be gone with that person, so will it be worth it. ?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Think about it for a while, i would love to know what you feel, or what would you do. Would love to read your responses. </p>

<p>And Thank you for being a part of my social experiment.  </p>
