<p>It's been over a month since my last update. Lately, I've been fully immersed in various projects, always striving to learn and grow. While it's invigorating to keep my mind engaged, I've noticed the toll it takes on my body—a classic case of the brain-body trade-off, as I like to call it.</p>

<p>Recently, I delved into exploring meta AI on Instagram, conducting some experiments out of curiosity. One such experiment led me to search for the least active individual on social media—myself—and my blog page. Surprisingly, the AI unearthed some resources about a politician in Sikkim who shares my surname. Regarding my blog, teelepcha.com, it provided a fair assessment but ended with a gentle reminder: "Please note that the blog may not be active anymore as the latest post was from March 9, 2024." It was both amusing and a subtle nudge to keep my blog updated.</p>

<p>In a subsequent search, the AI amusingly claimed I had over a thousand blogs. Of course, I understand that the AI wasn't designed for such specific inquiries, but it was a fun experiment nonetheless. I commend the team at meta for their remarkable advancements, transforming an app once dedicated to sharing photos and posts into a platform powered by AI. It's truly a fascinating era we live in.</p>

<p>So, thank you to the brilliant minds at meta for this innovation. I'll take heed of the AI's gentle reminder and strive to maintain a regular cadence of blog updates—lest my friend, the meta AI, points out my slacking again.</p>

<p>By the way this is a "Bhutanese man on Mars", image generated by meta AI, compared to other generative AI, it can still be optimized better, but I understand the sheer effort of individuals and the brains behind all this, so bravo to everyone who worked on this👏👏👏. </p>
