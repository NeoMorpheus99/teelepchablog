If it were the past me, I would have been too critical of myself for not making proper use of these two months—only to end up ruining the third as well by overthinking what I lacked. But what did I actually do during this time?<br>

I went back to my roots, my village. Far from the hustle and bustle of the town and the constant race to prove one's worth, I found peace there. Life moved at a slower pace. People were content, going about their daily work—mostly farming and raising livestock. Their world was limited to that place; they didn’t concern themselves with third-world struggles, materialism, capitalism, or consumerism. Nothing mattered more than feeding their cows and tending to their fields.<br>

Watching them, I often reflect on the immense goals we set for ourselves—the unrealistic expectations that, at times, are unnecessary. Sometimes, the simplest things are all that truly matter. However, I also recognize the importance of thinking beyond the box and pursuing something wholeheartedly, with deep passion. After all, that’s how we progress as humans.<br>

Although I am a huge tech enthusiast and always eager to explore new things, I can’t help but feel—perhaps from a dystopian perspective—that the closer we get to high-end technology, the further we drift from the beauty of humanity. These two months, away from my tech, were the best getaway for me.<br>
