<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Way back in the days i came across a quote some where, which unfortunately I could not find it again, however its goes somewhere along the lines of </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"A man remains wise as long as he continues to learn, but becomes a fool as soon as he believes he has learned all there is to know." - unknown</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This quote has had a profound impact in my life, serving as a constant reminder that there is always something more to learn. However, who would have thought that it would become like a double edged sword for me. I find myself mostly in front of my computer, clicking, typing and constantly exploring and absorbing information,  from merging techs to revisiting the older ones. </p>

<p>Reflecting on the question "what could I do more of?" -  there are numerous things I wish I could make more time for, but at the top of the list would be going out more and connecting with people more often. I sometimes miss the version of myself who was out there, living life more actively. But with time, responsibilities have shaped me into who I am now: often reserved, thoughtful, and occasionally too ambitious.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I suppose this is part of the phase we call "adulting,", a subject that we never explored in our schooling days.  Many of my close friends have also embarked on their own journeys, pursuing futures theyâ€™ve envisioned for themselves. Sometimes, I wish I could press pause on my endless pursuit of knowledge and spend more time with friends and family, grounding myself in those moments.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, that was 15 mins of my precious time, thinking and writing this, now I must get back to staring at my code, that has not been working for the past 2 hours... got to kill that bug.</p>
