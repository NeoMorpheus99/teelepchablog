<p>I am glad that I stumbled upon this question on today’s writing prompt. It seems like a simple question and yet somehow it opens up a portal for me to think deep and reflect on myself. What if I really had a biography someday, what would it contain? Would I have a story to tell? Will I fulfill the purpose with which I was born on this earth?&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After much introspection, I would name my biography as “Norbu : an ordinary man’s tale”. Yes, it's amusing and simple but I feel it encapsulates the essence of my being very well. In a world enamored by grandeur and flamboyance, I find contentment in life's simplest pleasures, a little old fashioned in that sense.</p>

<p>Well, the reason for this title is that it embodies me as a person, an ordinary man, and my belief that greatness is not measured by accolades or grand achievements, but by the impact we have on those around us and the fulfillment we find in pursuing our passions, like for me I aspire to keep learning and keep doing things which I love.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So , if I ever have a biography, it would not contain anything extraordinary, but rather a testament of a man that came from a humble beginning, had his highs and lows, and someday rested peacefully knowing that the will with which he was brought to this earth is fulfilled. A simple tale that reminds everyone that life's truest meanings don't lie in the magnitude of our accomplishments, but in the depth of our character and the impact we leave on the world around us.</p>
