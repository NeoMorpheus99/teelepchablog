I am Norbu Tshering Lepcha, a dedicated and a curious computer science student with a passion for Machine Learning, AI and its applications and a minor in Robotics, which are all directed towards a deep passion to address modern issues and solve problems.

I have worked on several mini projects, some of which are available in my GitHub repo. My curiosity to explore is my greatest strength which keeps me motivated to to more and learn more.

My Interests

Beyond the digital landscape, you'll often find me deeply engrossed in a book, as I have a deep-seated love for reading. Writing is another avenue through which I express myself, trying to weave words into narratives that in some ways capture the essence of my thoughts and experiences. History, art, and literature hold a special place in my heart.

In addition to my tech pursuits, I channel my creative energies into graphic designing. From crafting visually appealing concepts to bringing ideas to life through design, I enjoy the dynamic and expressive world of graphic arts.

Due to this I have done several freelance work in the field of graphics designing ranging from logo designing to making flyers and posters. So, I am always open to collaborate and share ideas.
